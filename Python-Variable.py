"""Creating Variables

Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.

A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to   it."""
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)
"""Variables do   not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set."""
x = 4
